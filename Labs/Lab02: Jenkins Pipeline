Task 01:
Configure a Jenkins pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application to build this project and to run some tests. Refer the requirements below:
- Create a Jenkins pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application. 
- This job should run the pipeline from kubernetes-devops-security repository's Jenkinsfile.
- Update the Jenkinsfile in the kubernetes-devops-security repository to add a stage, which should build the artifacts using maven, The command you would need to run is mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
- remember to save the artifcats (jar files) so that we can download it later.
- Remember to install all required Jenkins plugins which might be needed for this pipeline.

Solution:
From the Jenkins UI install the below mentioned plugins:
Pipeline
Git

Now, create a pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application.
Further from the vscode update the Jenkinsfile as below and push the changes to the origin:
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Artifact - Maven') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
        archive 'target/*.jar'
      }
    }
  }
}


Task 02:
Modify the pipeline that was created in the previous step and add another stage for running unit tests using maven.
In this same stage add a post field to utilise Jacoco to generate and visualise the tests report in Jenkins.

Solution:
From the Jenkins UI install the below mentioned plugins:
Jacoco
JUnit

From the vscode update the Jenkinsfile as below and push the changes to the origin:
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Artifact - Maven') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
        archive 'target/*.jar'
      }
    }
    stage('Unit Tests - JUnit and Jacoco') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn test"
      }
      post {
        always {
          junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
          jacoco execPattern: 'target/jacoco.exec'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


Task 03:
Let us now configure a webhook on the Gitea server for the kubernetes-devops-security repository so that any push we make to this repository triggers the Jenkins job automatically.
Create the required webhook in Gitea for kubernetes-devops-security repository and make the necessary changes in devsecops-numeric-application pipeline job as well.

Solution:
From the Jenkins UI install the below plugin:
Gitea

Create a webhook in Gitea as per steps given below:
- Login into the Gitea server using the given credentials.
- Go to the kubernetes-devops-security repository.
- Click on Settings then Webhooks
- Click on Add Webhook and select Gitea option.
- In the Target URL box enter the Jenkins URL like this https://8091-port-b5f9272e1c2c4b00.kk-lab-dev.kodekloud.com/gitea-webhook/post (remember to replace this URL with the original URL)
- Leave the other options as it is and click on Add Webhook

Now login into Jenkins and follow below given steps:
- Click on Manage Jenkins and then Configure System
- Look for Gitea Servers option and click on Add->Gitea Server
- Under Gitea Server Name enter any name like Gitea
- Under Server URL enter the Gitea server URL like https://8092-port-aa1fa1f8b8d9420e.kk-lab-dev.kodekloud.com (remember to replace the URL with the original URL)

Finally click on Save
Go to the devsecops-numeric-application job configuration and enable Poll SCM option in pipeline job and save.
